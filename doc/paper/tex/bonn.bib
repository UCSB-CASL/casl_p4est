  abstract = {We study approximation properties of hp-finite element subspaces of
	$H(div, \Omega)$ and $H(rot, \Omega)$ on a polygonal domain $\Omega$
	using Brezzi-Douglas-Fortin-Marini (BDFM) or Raviart-Thomas (RT)
	elements. Approximation theoretic results are derived for the hp-version
	finite element method on non-quasi-uniform meshes of quadrilateral
	elements with hanging nodes for functions belonging to weighted Sobolev
	spaces $H_{\omega}^{s,\ell}(\Omega)$ and the countably normed spaces
	$\mathcal{B}_{w}^{\ell}(Omega)$ . These results culminate in a proof
	of the characteristic exponential convergence property of the hp-version
	finite element method on suitably designed meshes under similar conditions
	needed for the analysis of the $H^{1}(\Omega)$ case. By way of illustration,
	exponential convergence rates are deduced for mixed hp-approximation
	of flow in porous media.},

	Boltzmann method for the simulation of electron beam melting processes.
	The multi-distribution approach incorporates a state-of-the-art volume
	of fluid free surface method to handle the complex interaction between
	gas, liquid, and solid phases. The paper provides a detailed explanation
	of the modeling of the electron beam gun properties, such as the
	absorption rate and the energy dissipation. Additionally, an algorithm
	for the construction of a realistic powder bed is discussed. Special
	emphasis is placed to a parallel, optimized implementation due to
	the high computational costs of 3D simulations. Finally, a thorough
	validation of the heat equation and the solid-liquid phase transition
	demonstrates the capability of the approach to considerably improve
	the electron beam melting process.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of flow through static
	random assemblies of monodisperse, spherical particles. A lattice
	Boltzmann approach based on a two relaxation time collision operator
	is used to obtain reliable predictions of the particle drag by direct
	numerical simulation. From these predictions a closure law F (Re
	p, {$\phi$}) of the drag force relationship to the bed density {$\phi$} and the
	particle Reynolds number Re p is derived. The present study includes
	densities φ ranging from 0.01 to 0.35 with Re p ranging up to 300,
	that is compiled into a single drag correlation valid for the whole
	range. The correlation has a more compact expression compared to
	others previously reported in literature. At low particle densities,
	the new correlation is close to the widely-used Wen {\&} Yu-correlation.
	Recently, there has been reported a discrepancy between results obtained
	using different numerical methods, namely the comprehensive lattice
	Boltzmann study of Beetstra et al. (2007) and the predictions based
	on an immersed boundary – pseudo-spectral Navier–Stokes approach
	(Tenneti et al., 2011). The present study excludes significant finite
	resolution effects, which have been suspected to cause the reported
	deviations, but does not coincide exactly with either of the previous
	studies. This indicates the need for yet more accurate simulation
	methods in the future.},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the simulation of floating rigid bodies in
	free surface flows. For that, a lattice Boltzmann based model for
	liquid gas solid flows is presented. The approach is built upon previous
	work for the simulation of liquid solid particle suspensions on the
	one hand, and on an interface-capturing technique for liquid gas
	free surface flows on the other. The incompressible liquid flow is
	approximated by a lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the dynamics of
	the compressible gas are neglected. We show how the particle model
	and the interface capturing technique can be combined by a novel
	set of dynamic cell conversion rules. We also evaluate the behaviour
	of the free surface-particle interaction in simulations. One test
	case is the rotational stability of non-spherical rigid bodies floating
	on a plane water surfaces a classical hydrostatic problem known from
	naval architecture. We show the consistency of our method in this
	kind of flows and obtain convergence towards the ideal solution for
	the heeling stability of a floating box.},

	compute intensive. Only by parallel simulations on modern supercomputers
	the computational demands of complex simulation tasks can be satisfied.
	Facing these computational demands {GPUs} offer high performance,
	as they provide the high floating point performance and memory to
	processor chip bandwidth. To successfully utilize {GPU} clusters
	for the daily business of a large community, usable software frameworks
	must be established on these clusters. The development of such software
	frameworks is only feasible with maintainable software designs that
	consider performance as a design objective right from the start.
	For this work we extend the software design concepts to achieve more
	efficient and highly scalable multi-GPU parallelization within our
	software framework waLBerla for multi-physics simulations centered
	around the lattice Boltzmann method. Our software designs now also
	support a pure-MPI and a hybrid parallelization approach capable
	of heterogeneous simulations using {CPUs} and {GPUs} in parallel.
	For the first time weak and strong scaling performance results obtained
	on the Tsubame 2.0 cluster for more than 1000 {GPUs} are presented
	using waLBerla. With the help of a new communication model the parallel
	efficiency of our implementation is investigated and analyzed in
	a detailed and structured performance analysis. The suitability of
	the waLBerla framework for production runs on large {GPU} clusters
	is demonstrated. As one possible application we show results of strong
	scaling experiments for flows through a porous medium.},

	on a tetrahedral bisection-based adaptive mesh, which does not support
	common space-filling curve (SFC) approaches to enumerate and sort
	the elements. The order of elements plays an important role for dynamically
	adaptive meshes. Meshes considered in this study change their topology
	during simulation time, i.e. h-adaptive methods, which generate and
	remove cells for local mesh refinement. These creation and removal
	processes lead to a non-consecutive numbering of the elements and
	randomly distribute the corresponding computational data in memory.
	Therefore, the mesh generator amatos gathers the data in arrays and
	provide them for numerical computations. This gathering naturally
	sorts data in memory and different ordering methods can be applied
	to increase cache efficiency of the simulation. As the sorting itself
	needs to be computed, keeping the overhead small is desirable. There
	exist fast iterative constructions of a SFC-induced order for certain
	bisection based refinement methods. However, we are not aware of
	any study analyzing the data locality for adaptive meshes not supporting
	the space-filling curve order. Our test case consists of an h-adaptive
	tracer simulation on a tetrahedral mesh, which denies a simple construction
	of an SFC. We perform a depth-first traversal of the refinement tree
	leading to a quasi space-filling curve (qSFC) order. We introduce
	the face sharing order as an easy-to-use-method to insert the elements
	into the tree and compare it to a more classical approach keeping
	explicitly track of the qSFC. For comparison we derive statistical
	measures of locality based on the mesh connectivity and show that
	both qSFC strategies deliver a good quality, but with a slightly
	better performance of the face sharing order.},

	Boltzmann multi distribution approach to handle the interaction between
	the electron beam and the material. Modeling the electron beam gun
	properties, such as absorption and energy dissipation, is explained
	in detail. Special emphasis is given to an implementation in a distributed
	and parallel environment due to the high computational costs of three
	dimensional simulations. Finally, a thorough validation for the beam
	absorption behavior against the analytical solution is proceeded
	and a concluding example in a powder bed shows the capability of
	the approach to simulate and support understanding the electron beam
	melting process.},

	Both codes employ second order accurate compact interpolation at

	compact interpolation technique is both simple and accurate, it produces
	almost no computational overhead as compared to the lattice Boltzmann
	method for uniform grids in terms of node updates per second. To
	the best of our knowledge, the current paper presents the first study
	on multi-core parallelization of the lattice Boltzmann method with
	inhomogeneous grid spacing and nested time stepping for both {CPUs}
