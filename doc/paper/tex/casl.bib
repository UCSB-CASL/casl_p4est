@article{Bars;Worster:06:Solidification-of-a-,
	Abstract = {A finite-element simulation of binary alloy solidification based on a single-domain formulation is presented and tested. Resolution of phase change is first checked by comparison with the analytical results of Worster [M.G. Worster, Solidification of an alloy from a cooled boundary, J. Fluid Mech. 167 (1986) 481--501] for purely diffusive solidification. Fluid dynamical processes without phase change are then tested by comparison with previous numerical studies of thermal convection in a pure fluid [G. de Vahl Davis, Natural convection of air in a square cavity: a bench mark numerical solution, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 3 (1983) 249--264; D.A. Mayne, A.S. Usmani, M. Crapper, h-adaptive finite element solution of high Rayleigh number thermally driven cavity problem, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Heat Fluid Flow 10 (2000) 598--615; D.C. Wan, B.S.V. Patnaik, G.W. Wei, A new benchmark quality solution for the buoyancy driven cavity by discrete singular convolution, Numer. Heat Transf. 40 (2001) 199--228], in a porous medium with a constant porosity [G. Lauriat, V. Prasad, Non-darcian effects on natural convection in a vertical porous enclosure, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf. 32 (1989) 2135--2148; P. Nithiarasu, K.N. Seetharamu, T. Sundararajan, Natural convective heat transfer in an enclosure filled with fluid saturated variable porosity medium, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf. 40 (1997) 3955--3967] and in a mixed liquid--porous medium with a spatially variable porosity [P. Nithiarasu, K.N. Seetharamu, T. Sundararajan, Natural convective heat transfer in an enclosure filled with fluid saturated variable porosity medium, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf. 40 (1997) 3955--3967; N. Zabaras, D. Samanta, A stabilized volume-averaging finite element method for flow in porous media and binary alloy solidification processes, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng. 60 (2004) 1103--1138]. Finally, new benchmark solutions for simultaneous flow through both fluid and porous domains and for convective solidification processes are presented, based on the similarity solutions in corner-flow geometries recently obtained by Le Bars and Worster [M. Le Bars, M.G. Worster, Interfacial conditions between a pure fluid and a porous medium: implications for binary alloy solidification, J. Fluid Mech. (in press)]. Good agreement is found for all tests, hence validating our physical and numerical methods. More generally, the computations presented here could now be considered as standard and reliable analytical benchmarks for numerical simulations, specifically and independently testing the different processes underlying binary alloy solidification.},

	Abstract = {A novel diffuse interface model is presented for the direct numerical simulation of microstructure evolution in solidification processes involving convection in the liquid phase. The solidification front is treated as a moving interface in the diffuse approximation as known from phase-field theories. The no-slip condition between the melt and the solid is realized via a drag resistivity in the diffuse interface region. The model is shown to accurately reproduce the usual sharp interface conditions in the limit of a thin diffuse interface region. A first test of the model is provided for flow through regular arrays of cylinders with a stationary interface. Then, two examples are presented that involve solid/liquid phase-change: (i) coarsening of a mush of a binary alloy, where both the interface curvature and the flow permeability evolve with time, and (ii) dendritic growth in the presence of melt convection with particular emphasis on the operating point of the tip.},

@article{Belluzzi;Sacchi:91:A-five-conductance-m,
	Abstract = {The origin of the action potential in neurones has yet to be answered satisfactorily for most cells. We present here a five-conductance model of the somatic membrane of the mature and intact sympathetic neurone studied in situ in the isolated rat superior cervical ganglion under two-electrode voltage-clamp conditions. The neural membrane hosts five separate types of voltage-dependent ionic conductances, which have been isolated at 37 degrees C by using simple manipulations such as conditioning-test protocols and external ionic pharmacological treatments. The total current could be separated into two distinct inward components: (1) the sodium current, INa, and (2) the calcium current, ICa; and three outward components: (1) the delayed rectifier, IKV, (2) the transient IA, and (3) the calcium-dependent IKCa. Each current has been kinetically characterized in the framework of the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme used for the squid giant axon. Continuous mathematical functions are now available for the activation and inactivation (where present) gating mechanisms of each current which, together with the maximum conductance values measured in the experiments, allow for a satisfactory reconstruction of the individual current tracings over a wide range of membrane voltage. The results obtained are integrated in a full mathematical model which, by describing the electrical behaviour of the neurone under current-clamp conditions, leads to a quantitative understanding of the physiological firing pattern. While, as expected, the fast inward current carried by Na+ contributes to the depolarizing phase of the action potential, the spike falling phase is more complex than previous explanations. IKCa, with a minor contribution from IKV, repolarizes the neurone only under conditions of low cell internal negativity. Their role becomes less pronounced in the voltage range negative to -60 mV, where membrane repolarization allows IA to deinactivate. In the spike arising from these voltage levels the membrane repolarization is mainly sustained by IA, which proves to be the only current sufficiently fast and large enough to recharge the membrane capacitor at the speed observed during activity. Different modes of firing coexist in the same neurone and the switching from one to another is fast and governed by the membrane potential level, which makes the selection between the different voltage-dependent channel systems. The neurone thus seems to be prepared to operate within a wide voltage range; the results presented indicate the basic factors underlying the different discrete behaviours.},

Recalling and extending results from the literature, we compute phase response curves (PRCs) valid near bifurcations to periodic firing for Hindmarsh-Rose, Hodgkin-Huxley, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and Morris-Lecar models, encompassing the four generic (codimension one) bifurcations. Phase density equations are then used to analyze the role of the bifurcation, and the resulting PRC, in responses to stimuli. In particular, we explore the interplay among stimulus duration, baseline firing frequency, and population-level response patterns.

	Abstract = {One-dimensional drift-diffusion model accounting for the unique properties of group-III nitrides is employed to simulate the carrier transport and radiative/non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes in light emitting diode heterostructures. Mixed finite-element method is used for numerical implementation of the model. The emission spectra are computed via the self-consistent solution of the Schr{\"o}dinger--Poisson equations with account of complex valence band structure of nitride materials. Simulations of a number of single- and multiple-quantum well blue and ultraviolet light emitting diodes are presented and compared with available observations. Specific features of the III-nitride LED operation are considered in terms of modelling. Applicability of the drift-diffusion model to analysis of III-nitride LEDs is proved and still open questions are discussed.},

@article{Burman;Jacot;Picasso:04:Adaptive-finite-elem,
	Abstract = {A multiphase-field model for the description of coalescence in a binary alloy is solved numerically using adaptive finite elements with high aspect ratio. The unknown of the multiphase-field model are the three phase fields (solid phase 1, solid phase 2, and liquid phase), a Lagrange multiplier and the concentration field. An Euler implicit scheme is used for time discretization, together with continuous, piecewise linear finite elements. At each time step, a linear system corresponding to the three phases plus the Lagrange multiplier has to be solved. Then, the linear system pertaining to concentration is solved. An adaptive finite element algorithm is proposed. In order to reduce the number of mesh vertices, the generated meshes contain elements with high aspect ratio. The refinement and coarsening criteria are based on an error indicator which has already been justified theoretically for simpler problems.
Numerical results on two test cases show the efficiency of the method.},

We present a variety of example problems to demonstrate the accuracy and utility of the method. We also use the model to interpret experimental results obtained using directional solidification in a cryomicroscope.},

@article{Danzl;Hespanha;Moehlis:09:Event-Based-Minimum-,
	Abstract = {We present an event-based feedback control method for randomizing the asymptotic phase of oscillatory neurons. Phase randomization is achieved by driving the neuron's state to its phaseless set, a point at which its phase is undefined and is extremely sensitive to background noise. We consider the biologically relevant case of a fixed magnitude constraint on the stimulus signal, and show how the control objective can be accomplished in minimum time. The control synthesis problem is addressed using the minimum-time-optimal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman framework, which is quite general and can be applied to any spiking neuron model in the conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. We also use this methodology to compute a feedback control protocol for optimal spike rate increase. This framework provides a straightforward means of visualizing isochrons, without actually calculating them in the traditional way. Finally, we present an extension of the phase randomizing control scheme that is applied at the population level, to a network of globally coupled neurons that are firing in synchrony. The applied control signal desynchronizes the population in a demand-controlled way.},

@article{Dorr;Fattebert;Wickett;etal:10:A-numerical-algorith,
	Abstract = {We describe an algorithm for the numerical solution of a phase-field model (PFM) of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline materials. The PFM system of equations includes a local order parameter, a quaternion representation of local orientation and a species composition parameter. The algorithm is based on the implicit integration of a semidiscretization of the PFM system using a backward difference formula (BDF) temporal discretization combined with a Newton--Krylov algorithm to solve the nonlinear system at each time step. The BDF algorithm is combined with a coordinate-projection method to maintain quaternion unit length, which is related to an important solution invariant. A key element of the Newton--Krylov algorithm is the selection of a preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of the Generalized Minimum Residual algorithm used to solve the Jacobian linear system in each Newton step. Results are presented for the application of the algorithm to 2D and 3D examples.},

@article{Duddu;Chopp;Voorhees;etal:11:Diffusional-evolutio,
	Abstract = {A sharp-interface numerical formulation using an Eulerian description aimed at modeling diffusional evolution of precipitates produced by phase transformations in elastic media, is presented. The extended finite element method (XFEM) is used to solve the field equations and the level set method is used to evolve the precipitate--matrix interface. This new formulation is capable of handling microstructures with arbitrarily shaped particles and capturing their topological transitions without needing the mesh to conform with the precipitate--matrix interface. The XFEM makes it possible to model the precipitate and the matrix to be both elastically anisotropic and inhomogeneous with ease. The interface evolution velocity is evaluated using a domain integral scheme [1] that is consistent with the sharp interface. Numerical examples modeling two distinct phases of particle evolution, growth (dendritic evolution) and equilibration (Ostwald ripening) are presented. To overcome the issue of grid anisotropy in growth simulations, a random grid rotation scheme is implemented in conjunction with a bicubic spline interpolation scheme. Growing shapes are dendritic while equilibrium shapes are squarish and in this respect our simulation results are in agreement with those presented in the literature [2--4].},

Alexandrou (Int. J. Numer. Methods Eng.28, 2383, 1989) has been modified and extended to include more general boundary conditions. The latter includes the explicit presence of an ampoule (with a complex shape) that contains the solid and the melt from which it is growing. Heat transfer between the ampoule and the external environment, time-dependent thermal boundary conditions, nonmonotonic temperature distributions, and species diffusion in the melt and crystal are also taken into account. Thus, our extended formulation encompasses a wider class of solidification problems than previous IFEM methods. Numerical experiments that illustrate the suitability of the extended IFEM are presented. In particular, we present a simulation of the directional solidification of zinc cadmium telluride using boundary conditions corresponding to an actual experiment scenario.},

	Abstract = {We describe an implementation of a parallel finite-difference algorithm for the simulation of alloy solidification in three dimensions using the phase-field model. We also describe the visualization of the output from this simulator. Although this type of simulation has been accomplished before in two dimensions, extending this to three dimensions presents scaling problems for both the computations and the subsequent rendering of the results for visualization. This is due to the O(n4) execution time of the simulation algorithm as well as the O(n3) space requirements for holding the required three-dimensional arrays of field parameters. Additionally, rendering the output of the three-dimensional simulation stresses the available software and hardware when the simulations extend over computational grids of size 500×500×500. Parallel computing libraries and hardware-supported rendering combine to help make this simulator simple to implement, portable, and efficient even when run in heterogeneous environments. This has all been accomplished using simple static uniform grids and finite differencing.},

	Abstract = {We extend a recently introduced method for numerically solving partial differential equations on implicit surfaces [M. Bertalm{\'\i}o, L.T. Cheng, S. Osher, G. Sapiro. Variational problems and partial differential equations on implicit surfaces, J. Comput. Phys. 174 (2) (2001) 759--780] to fourth order PDEs including the Cahn--Hilliard equation and a lubrication model for curved surfaces. By representing a surface in R N as the level set of a smooth function, ϕ, we compute the PDE using only finite differences on a standard Cartesian mesh in R N . The higher order equations introduce a number of challenges that are of less concern when applying this method to first and second order PDEs. Many of these problems, such as time-stepping restrictions and large stencil sizes, are shared by standard fourth order equations in Euclidean domains, but others are caused by the extreme degeneracy of the PDEs that result from this method and the general geometry. We approach these difficulties by applying convexity splitting methods, ADI schemes, and iterative solvers. We discuss in detail the differences between computing these fourth order equations and computing the first and second order PDEs considered in earlier work. We explicitly derive schemes for the linear fourth order diffusion, the Cahn--Hilliard equation for phase transition in a binary alloy, and surface tension driven flows on complex geometries. Numerical examples validating our methods are presented for these flows for data on general surfaces.},

	Abstract = {An implicit, second-order space and time discretization scheme together with a parallel multigrid method involving a strip grid domain partitioning has been developed to solve fully coupled, nonlinear phase field equations involving solute and heat transport for multiple solidifying dendrites. The computational algorithm has been shown to be stable and monotonously convergent, and allowed time marching steps that were 3--4 orders of magnitude larger than those employed in similar explicit approaches, resulting in an increase of 3--4 orders of magnitude in computing efficiency. Full solute and thermal coupling was achieved for metallic alloys with a realistic, high Lewis number of &gt;104. The parallel multigrid computing scheme is shown to provide a scalable methodology that allowed the efficient use of distributed supercomputing resource to simulate the evolution of tens of complex shaped 2D dendrites in a computational domain containing tens or even hundreds of millions of grid points. The simulations have provided insight into the dynamic interplay of many growing dendrites in a more realistic fully coupled thermal-solute condition, capturing for the first time fine scale features such as dendrite splitting.},

	Abstract = {The development of computer fluid dynamics has been closely associated with the evolution of large high-speed computers. At first the principal incentive was to produce numerical techniques for solving problems related to national defense. Soon, however, it was recognized that numerous additional scientific and engineering applications could be accomplished by means of modified techniques that extended considerably the capabilities of the early procedures. This paper describes some of this work at The Los Alamos National Laboratory, where many types of problems were solved for the first time with the newly emerging sequence of numerical capabilities. The discussions focus principally on those with which the author has been directly involved.},

	Abstract = {A sharp interface method is proposed for the dissolution of stoichiometric particles in multi-component alloys occurring during the heat treatments of as-cast aluminium alloys prior to hot extrusion. In the mathematical model, a number of non-linearly coupled diffusion equations are given to determine the position of the particle interface and the interfacial concentrations. A level set method is used to determine the interface position at each time step. Once the front position is known, a fixed-point iteration is used to find the interfacial concentrations. The model is applicable to both complete and incomplete dissolution in two and three spatial dimensions, and handles topological changes in a natural fashion. The numerical solution is compared with steady-state and self-similar exact solutions available for simple particle geometries. Subsequently, the model is applied to an AlMgSi-alloy to investigate the influence of the particle morphology in the dissolution kinetics.},

@article{Jou;Leo;Lowengrub:97:Microstructural-Evol,
	Abstract = {We simulate the diffusional evolution of microstructures produced by solid state diffusional transformations in elastically stressed binary alloys in two dimensions. The microstructure consists of arbitrarily shaped precipitates embedded coherently in an infinite matrix. The precipitate and matrix are taken to be elastically isotropic, although they may havedifferentelastic constants (elastically inhomogeneous). Both far-field applied strains and mismatch strains between the phases are considered. The diffusion and elastic fields are calculated using the boundary integral method, together with a small scale preconditioner to remove ill-conditioning. The precipitate--matrix interfaces are tracked using a nonstiff time updating method. The numerical method is spectrally accurate and efficient. Simulations of a single precipitate indicate that precipitate shapes depend strongly on the mass flux into the system as well as on the elastic fields. Growing shapes (positive mass flux) are dendritic while equilibrium shapes (zero mass flux) are squarish. Simulations of multiparticle systems show complicated interactions between precipitate morphology and the overall development of microstructure (i.e., precipitate alignment, translation, merging, and coarsening). In both single and multiple particle simulations, the details of the microstructural evolution depend strongly on the elastic inhomogeneity, misfit strain, and applied fields.},

The model uses the volume-averaging principles and combines the features of the enthalpy method for modeling growth, immersed boundary method for handling the rigid solid--liquid interfaces, and the volume of fluid method for tracking the advection of the dendrite. The algorithm also performs explicit--implicit coupling between the techniques used. A two-dimensional framework with incompressible and Newtonian fluid is considered. Validation with available literature is performed and dendrite growth in the presence of rotational and buoyancy driven flow fields is studied. It is seen that the flow fields significantly alter the position and morphology of the dendrites.},

@article{Katz;Worster:08:Simulation-of-direct,
	Abstract = {We have developed fully resolved, two-dimensional, finite volume simulations of directional solidification of a binary alloy in a Hele-Shaw cell. Use of Darcy's law and the Enthalpy Method throughout the computational domain allows us to avoid prescribing internal boundary conditions on the interfaces between solid, mushy, and liquid regions. We present a description of the theoretical model, computational approach, two reduced benchmark calculations, and simulations of the full governing equations. In simulations with parameter values that approximate experiments, boundary-layer-mode convection produces corrugations in the mush--liquid interface. Some of these corrugations become chimneys that grow and interact within the mushy layer. We consider two porosity--permeability relations and examine their consequences for chimney spacing and mushy layer height. Our results are broadly similar to experiments on directional solidification of NH 4 Cl [S.S.L. Peppin, H.E. Huppert, M.G. Worster, Steady-state solidification of aqueous ammonium chloride, J. Fluid Mech. 599 (2008) 465--476; S.H. Whiteoak, H. Huppert, M.G. Worster, Conditions for defect-free solidification of aqueous ammonium chloride in a quasi 2d directional solidification facility, J. Cryst. Growth (2008)]. We describe other simulations that are tuned to suppress boundary layer mode convection and that, instead, go unstable by the mushy layer mode [M.G. Worster, Instabilities of the liquid and mushy regions during solidification of alloys, J. Fluid Mech. 237 (1992) 649--669]. We investigate the morphological evolution of the mush well beyond the linear instability regime.},

	Abstract = {The hydrodynamics of anguilliform swimming motions was investigated using three-dimensional simulations of the fluid flow past a self-propelled body. The motion of the body is not specified a priori, but is instead obtained through an evolutionary algorithm used to optimize the swimming efficiency and the burst swimming speed. The results of the present simulations support the hypothesis that anguilliform swimmers modify their kinematics according to different objectives and provide a quantitative analysis of the swimming motion and the forces experienced by the body. The kinematics of burst swimming is characterized by the large amplitude of the tail undulations while the anterior part of the body remains straight. In contrast, during efficient swimming behavior significant lateral undulation occurs along the entire length of the body. In turn, during burst swimming, the majority of the thrust is generated at the tail, whereas in the efficient swimming mode, in addition to the tail, the middle of the body contributes significantly to the thrust. The burst swimming velocity is 42\% higher and the propulsive efficiency is 15\% lower than the respective values during efficient swimming. The wake, for both swimming modes, consists largely of a double row of vortex rings with an axis aligned with the swimming direction. The vortex rings are responsible for producing lateral jets of fluid, which has been documented in prior experimental studies. We note that the primary wake vortices are qualitatively similar in both swimming modes except that the wake vortex rings are stronger and relatively more elongated in the fast swimming mode. The present results provide quantitative information of three-dimensional fluid-body interactions that may complement related experimental studies. In addition they enable a detailed quantitative analysis, which may be difficult to obtain experimentally, of the different swimming modes linking the kinematics of the motion with the forces acting on the self-propelled body. Finally, the optimization procedure helps to identify, in a systematic fashion, links between swimming motion and biological function.},

@article{Kim;Kang;Lowengrub:04:Conservative-multigr,
	Abstract = {We develop a conservative, second-order accurate fully implicit discretization of the Navier--Stokes (NS) and Cahn--Hilliard (CH) system that has an associated discrete energy functional. This system provides a diffuse-interface description of binary fluid flows with compressible or incompressible flow components [R. Soc. Lond. Proc. Ser. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 454 (1998) 2617]. In this work, we focus on the case of flows containing two immiscible, incompressible and density-matched components. The scheme, however, has a straightforward extension to multi-component systems. To efficiently solve the discrete system at the implicit time-level, we develop a nonlinear multigrid method to solve the CH equation which is then coupled to a projection method that is used to solve the NS equation. We demonstrate convergence of our scheme numerically in both the presence and absence of flow and perform simulations of phase separation via spinodal decomposition. We examine the separate effects of surface tension and external flow on the decomposition. We find surface tension driven flow alone increases coalescence rates through the retraction of interfaces. When there is an applied external shear, the evolution of the flow is nontrivial and the flow morphology repeats itself in time as multiple pinchoff and reconnection events occur. Eventually, the periodic motion ceases and the system relaxes to a global equilibrium. The equilibria we observe appears has a similar structure in all cases although the dynamics of the evolution is quite different. We view the work presented in this paper as preparatory for a detailed investigation of liquid--liquid interfaces with surface tension where the interfaces separate two immiscible fluids [On the pinchoff of liquid--liquid jets with surface tension, in preparation]. To this end, we also include a simulation of the pinchoff of a liquid thread under the Rayleigh instability at finite Reynolds number.},

	Abstract = {We present an efficient and accurate method for searching for atomic configurations with target band structure properties. Our approach to this inverse problem is to search the atomic configuration space by repeatedly applying a forward solver, guiding the search toward the optimal configuration using a genetic algorithm. For the forward solver, we relax the atomic positions, then solve the Schr{\"o}dinger equation using a fast empirical pseudopotential method. We employ a hierarchical parallelism for the combined forward solver and genetic algorithm. This enables the optimization process to run on many more processors than would otherwise be possible. We have optimized AlGaAs alloys for maximum bandgap and minimum bandgap for several given compositions and discuss the results. This approach can be generalized to a wide range of applications in material design.},

@article{Krupa;Popovic;Kopell;etal:08:Mixed-Mode-Oscillati,
	Abstract = {Mixed-mode dynamics is a complex type of dynamical behavior that has been observed both numerically and experimentally in numerous prototypical systems in the natural sciences. The compartmental Wilson-Callaway model for the dopaminergic neuron is an example of a system that exhibits a wide variety of mixed-mode patterns upon variation of a control parameter. One characteristic feature of this system is the presence of multiple time scales. In this article, we study the Wilson-Callaway model from a geometric point of view. We show that the observed mixed-mode dynamics is caused by a slowly varying canard structure. By appropriately transforming the model equations, we reduce them to an underlying three-dimensional canonical form that can be analyzed via a slight adaptation of the approach developed by M. Krupa, N. Popovic, and N. Kopell (unpublished).},

@article{Kurz:94:Dendritic-growth,
	Abstract = {Dendritic structures are the predominant microstructural constituents of solidified alloys. The microstructural scales of dendrites, such as primary and secondary arm spacings, control the segregation pattern that largely determines the properties of the material. Within the past decade significant developments in understanding of dendritic structures have evolved through rigorous theoretical models and critical experimental studies in well characterised systems. These studies have resulted in the establishment of the criterion by which dendrite tip radius is selected under given experimental conditions. Furthermore, during the past decade, important advances have been made in predicting microstructural features that develop under rapid solidification conditions, and some key experimental studies have also been carried out to examine these microstructures. These studies have shown that the non-equilibrium conditions at the interface influence significantly the characteristics of dendrites formed under rapid solidification conditions. In this review the current status of dendritic growth phenomena are examined and critically assessed and key areas for the future directions of dendritic growth studies are suggested.},

An isochron is the set of all points in the basin of an attracting periodic orbit that converge to this periodic orbit with the same asymptotic phase. We compute the isochrons as one-dimensional parametrised curves with a method based on the continuation of suitable two-point boundary value problems. This allows us to present in detail the geometry of how the basin of attraction is foliated by isochrons. They exhibit extreme sensitivity and feature sharp turns, which is why Winfree had difficulties finding them. We observe that the sharp turns and sensitivity of the isochrons are associated with the slow-fast nature of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system; more specifically, it occurs near its repelling (unstable) slow manifold.},

@article{Lappa:03:An-attachment-kineti,
	Abstract = {This analysis exhibits a strong interdisciplinary nature and deals with advances in protein (crystal) engineering models and computational methods as well as with novel results on the relative importance of `controlling forces' in macromolecular crystal growth. The attention is focused in particular on microgravity fluid-dynamic aspects. From a numerical point of view, the growing crystal gives rise to a moving boundary problem. A `kinetic-coefficient-based' volume tracking method is specifically and carefully developed according to the complex properties and mechanisms of macromolecular protein crystal growth taking into account the possibility of anisotropic (faceted) surface-orientation-dependent growth. The method is used to shed some light on the interplay of surface attachment kinetics and mass transport (diffusive or convective) in liquid phase and on several mechanisms still poorly understood. It is shown that the size of a growing crystal plays a `critical role' in the relative importance of surface effects and in determining the intensity of convection. Convective effects, in turn, are found to impact growth rates, macroscopic structures of precipitates, particle size and morphology as well as the mechanisms driving growth. The paper introduces a novel computational method (that simulates the growth due to the slow addition of solute molecules to a lattice and can handle the shape of organic growing crystals under the influence of natural convection) and, at the same time, represents a quite exhaustive attempt to help organic crystal growers to discern the complex interrelations among the various parameters under one's control (that are not independent of one another) and to elaborate rational guidelines relating to physical factors that can influence the probability of success in crystallizing protein substances.},

@article{Leo;Lowengrub;Nie:00:Microstructural-Evol,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of microstructural evolution in binary alloys in two dimensions. The microstructure consists of arbitrarily shaped precipitates embedded in a matrix. Both the precipitates and the matrix are taken to be elastically anisotropic, with different elastic constants. The interfacial energy at the precipitate--matrix interfaces is also taken to be anisotropic. This is an extension of the inhomogeneous isotrpic problem considered by H.-J. Jou et al. (1997, J. Comput. Phys.131, 109). Evolution occurs via diffusion among the precipitates such that the total (elastic plus interfacial) energy decreases; this is accounted for by a modified Gibbs--Thomson boundary condition at the interfaces. The coupled diffusion and elasticity equations are reformulated using boundary integrals. An efficient preconditioner for the elasticity problem is developed based on a small scale analysis of the equations. The solution to the coupled elasticity-diffusion problem is implemented in parallel. Precipitate evolution is tracked by special non-stiff time stepping algorithms that guarantee agreement between physical and numerical equilibria. Results show that small elastic inhomogeneities in cubic systems can have a strong effect on precipitate evolution. For example, in systems where the elastic constants of the precipitates are smaller than those of the matrix, the particles move toward each other, where the rate of approach depends on the degree of inhomogeneity. Anisotropic surface energy can either enhance or reduce this effect, depending on the relative orientations of the anisotropies. Simulations of the evolution of multiple precipitates indicate that the elastic constants and surface energy control precipitate morphology and strongly influence nearest neighbor interactions. However, for the parameter ranges considered, the overall evolution of systems with large numbers of precipitates is primarily driven by the overall reduction in surface energy. Finally, we consider a problem related to the microstructure of fully orthotropic geological materials.},

@article{Lubachevsky:88:Efficient-parallel-s,
	Abstract = {An event-driven method for parallel simulation of a class dynamic Monte Carlo models is presented. The method can be applied to several models studied in the computational physics such as Ising spin simulations by the method of Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller, continuous time Ising spin simulation by Glauber, and the dynamic binary alloy simulation. Unlike previously known parallel multi-spin algorithms, the proposed algorithms do not change the simulated model. For example, the asynchrony and randomness of update time arrivals which are present in Glauber's formulation, are not disturbed here and the simulated update history is precisely the same as it is in the serial algorithm. The theoretical efficiency evaluation is encouraging: for 768 × 768 spins using a parallel processor with 256 processing elements, the estimated efficiency is not lower than 71%. This means a parallel speed-up of 180 in the computations which were previously believed inherently serial. The algorithm by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz can be incorporated, further contributing to speed-up.},

	Abstract = {We consider natural convection in flow saturated porous media with random porosity. The porosity is treated as a random field and a stochastic finite element method is developed. The stochastic projection method is considered for the solution of the high-dimensional stochastic Navier--Stokes equations since it leads to the uncoupling of the velocity and pressure degrees of freedom. Because of the porosity dependence of the pressure gradient term in the governing flow equations, one cannot use the first-order projection method. A stabilized stochastic finite element second-order projection method is presented based on a pressure gradient projection. A two-dimensional stochastic problem with moderate and large variation in the random porosity field is examined and the results are compared with Monte-Carlo and sparse grid (Smolyak) collocation approaches. Excellent agreement between these results indicates the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Mauroy;Mezic:12:On-the-Use-of-Fourie,
	Abstract = {The concept of isochrons is crucial for the analysis of asymptotically periodic systems. Roughly, isochrons are sets of points that partition the basin of attraction of a limit cycle according to the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories. The computation of global isochrons (in the whole basin of attraction) is however difficult, and the existing methods are inefficient in high-dimensional spaces. In this context, we present a novel (forward integration) algorithm for computing the global isochrons of high-dimensional dynamics, which is based on the notion of Fourier time averages evaluated along the trajectories. Such Fourier averages in fact produce eigenfunctions of the Koopman semigroup associated with the system, and isochrons are obtained as level sets of those eigenfunctions. The method is supported by theoretical results and validated by several examples of increasing complexity, including the 4-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley model. In addition, the framework is naturally extended to the study of quasiperiodic systems and motivates the definition of generalized isochrons of the torus. This situation is illustrated in the case of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators.},

@article{Monaghan;Huppert;Worster:05:Solidification-using,
	Abstract = {We show how the numerical particle method smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be used to the simulate the freezing of one and two-component (binary alloy) systems. We first study the freezing of a pure a liquid, and compare our computations against exact results for one and two dimensional systems, including cases where there are point sources and the boundary of the system is irregular. The agreement with theory, where it is available, is very satisfactory. We then consider a two-component system which is initially entirely liquid and model it by a set of liquid SPH particles together with a set of virtual solid SPH particles which initially have no mass. During the thermal evolution and solidification of the system, mass is transferred from the liquid SPH particles to the ice (solid) SPH particles. For a binary melt, as the volume fraction of the solid increases the composition of the liquid is enriched in the component of the alloy that does not form the solid phase. In the case of salty water, this component is the salt. We find that the variation of temperature and liquid composition calculated with SPH is in close agreement with previous theories of mushy layers and gives similar agreement with experiment. In this initial study we simplify the calculations by assuming the solid particles remain in the position where they are formed: a good approximation for the case where the solution is cooled from above to form ice leaving behind a relatively light residual liquid, or cooled from below leaving behind a relatively heavy liquid. We compare our results with experiments on the freezing from below of an aqueous sodium nitrate solution [Nature 314 (1985) 703], and find that the agreement is very satisfactory.},

@article{Nabi;Mirzadeh;Gibou;etal:13:Minimum-Energy-Desyn,
	Abstract = {We employ optimal control theory to design an event-based, minimum energy, desynchronizing control stimulus for a network of pathologically synchronized, heterogeneously coupled neurons. This works by optimally driving the neurons to their phaseless sets, switching the control off, and letting the phases of the neurons randomize under intrinsic background noise. An event-based minimum energy input may be clinically desirable for deep brain stimulation treatment of neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease. The event-based nature of the input results in its administration only when it is necessary, which, in general, amounts to fewer applications, and hence, less charge transfer to and from the tissue. The minimum energy nature of the input may also help prolong battery life for implanted stimulus generators. For the example considered, it is shown that the proposed control causes a considerable amount of randomization in the timing of each neuron's next spike, leading to desynchronization for the network.},

In this paper, we investigate the time optimal control problem for periodically firing neurons, represented by different one-dimensional phase models, and find analytical expressions for the minimum and maximum values of inter-spike intervals achievable with small bounded control stimuli. We consider two cases: with a charge-balance constraint on the input, and without it. The analytical calculations are supported with numerical results for examples of qualitatively different neuron models.},

In addition we combine a second-order fully implicit time discretisation scheme with variable step size control to obtain an adaptive time and space discretisation method. The superiority of this method, compared to widely used fully explicit methods, with respect to CPU time and accuracy, is shown. Due to the high nonlinearity of the governing equations a robust and fast solver for systems of nonlinear algebraic equations is needed to solve the intermediate approximations per time step. We use a nonlinear multigrid solver which shows almost h-independent convergence behaviour.},

@article{Sampath;Zabaras:01:Numerical-Study-of-C,
	Abstract = {Directional solidification of a dilute electrically conducting binary alloy driven by the combined action of buoyancy, surface-tension, and electromagnetic forces is considered. A numerical methodology using a moving finite element technique is proposed for the simulation of the above phase change process. The melt is modeled as a Boussinesq fluid and the transient Navier--Stokes equations are solved simultaneously with the transient heat and solute transport equations. The location of the advancing solid--liquid interface is numerically determined using an energy preserving weak form of the Stefan condition. The standard SUPG/PSPG method for the simulation of incompressible fluid flow is here extended to flows driven by the combination of buoyancy, surface tension, and electromagnetic forces. A reference problem of directional solidification of a dilute germanium alloy in a horizontal open-boat configuration is considered. The relative influence of thermocapillary convection and buoyancy-driven convection on the solidification process is investigated by varying the Bond number. Thermocapillary convection is shown to have a significant influence on various solidification parameters, such as the shape of the solid--liquid interface and the solute segregation, especially under low gravity conditions. The influence of an external magnetic field on the reference solidification problem is investigated both in a normal and a reduced gravity environment. It is demonstrated that the application of an appropriate strong magnetic field significantly damps the melt flow and improves the solute segregation pattern. The relative influence of an external magnetic field on the solidification process is also studied by independently varying the orientation and magnitude of the applied magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {The dissolution of a disk-likeAl2Cuparticle is considered. A characteristic property is that initially the particle has a nonsmooth boundary. The mathematical model of this dissolution process contains a description of the particle interface, of which the position varies in time. Such a model is called a Stefan problem. It is impossible to obtain an analytical solution for a general two-dimensional Stefan problem, so we use the finite element method to solve this problem numerically. First, we apply a classical moving mesh method. Computations show that after some time steps the predicted particle interface becomes very unrealistic. Therefore, we derive a new method for the displacement of the free boundary based on the balance of atoms. This method leads to good results, also, for nonsmooth boundaries. Some numerical experiments are given for the dissolution of anAl2Cuparticle in anAl--Cualloy.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a family of fast ordered upwind methods for approximating solutions to a wide class of static Hamilton-Jacobi equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Standard techniques often rely on iteration to converge to the solution of a discretized version of the partial differential equation. Our fast methods avoid iteration through a careful use of information about the characteristic directions of the underlying partial differential equation. These techniques are of complexity O(M log M), where M is the total number of points in the domain. We consider anisotropic test problems in optimal control, seismology, and paths on surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Qualitatively incorrect bifurcation diagrams are computed unless the symmetries both of the solutions and of the underlying differential equation are properly accounted for. In the context of the computation of solutions to partial differential equations using the finite element method, this requires careful thought when designing a suitable computational domain and corresponding grid. Here we consider the problem of computing the interaction of hexagon and roll solutions bifurcating from a spatially uniform equilibrium solution of an E(2) equivariant partial differential equation. As an example of where such an interaction occurs we consider a partial differential equation describing the directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy. We show that if the symmetry is not taken into account then spurious disconnections can occur. We describe how to overcome this problem by constructing novel grids which have hexagonal symmetry and enough translational symmetry to enable the computation of the correct bifurcation structure.},

	Abstract = {A two-scale model based on a database approach is presented to investigate alloy solidification. Appropriate assumptions are introduced to describe the behavior of macroscopic temperature, macroscopic concentration, liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. These assumptions lead to a macroscale model with two unknown functions: liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. These functions are computed using information from microscale solutions of selected problems. This work addresses the selection of sample problems relevant to the interested problem and the utilization of data from the microscale solution of the selected sample problems. A computationally efficient model, which is different from the microscale and macroscale models, is utilized to find relevant sample problems. In this work, the computationally efficient model is a sharp interface solidification model of a pure material. Similarities between the sample problems and the problem of interest are explored by assuming that the liquid volume fraction and microstructure features are functions of solution features extracted from the solution of the computationally efficient model. The solution features of the computationally efficient model are selected as the interface velocity and thermal gradient in the liquid at the time the sharp solid--liquid interface passes through. An analytical solution of the computationally efficient model is utilized to select sample problems relevant to solution features obtained at any location of the domain of the problem of interest. The microscale solution of selected sample problems is then utilized to evaluate the two unknown functions (liquid volume fraction and microstructure features) in the macroscale model. The temperature solution of the macroscale model is further used to improve the estimation of the liquid volume fraction and microstructure features. Interpolation is utilized in the feature space to greatly reduce the number of required sample problems. The efficiency of the proposed multiscale framework is demonstrated with numerical examples that consider a large number of crystals. A computationally intensive fully-resolved microscale analysis is also performed to evaluate the accuracy of the multiscale framework.},

	Abstract = {A method combining features of front-tracking methods and fixed-domain methods is presented to model dendritic solidification of pure materials. To explicitly track the interface growth and shape of the solidifying crystals, a front-tracking approach based on the level set method is implemented. To easily model the heat and momentum transport, a fixed-domain method is implemented assuming a diffused freezing front where the liquid fraction is defined in terms of the level set function. The fixed-domain approach, by avoiding the explicit application of essential boundary conditions on the freezing front, leads to an energy conserving methodology that is not sensitive to the mesh size. To compute the freezing front morphology, an extended Stefan condition is considered. Applications to several classical Stefan problems and two- and three-dimensional crystal growth of pure materials in an undercooled melt including the effects of melt flow are considered. The computed results agree very well with available analytical solutions as well as with results obtained using front-tracking techniques and the phase-field method.},

Haataja, M. Grant, Phys. Rev. B 75 (2007) 064107] characterized by variable coefficients. Using the operator splitting method, the problem has been decomposed into sub-problems that can be solved more efficiently. A combination of non-trivial splitting with spectral semi-implicit solution leads to sets of algebraic equations of diagonal matrix form. Extensive testing of the method has been carried out to find the optimum balance among errors associated with time integration, spatial discretization, and splitting. We show that our method speeds up the computations by orders of magnitude relative to the conventional explicit finite difference scheme, while the costs of the pointwise implicit solution per timestep remains low. Also we show that due to its numerical dissipation, finite differencing can not compete with spectral differencing in terms of accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can efficiently be parallelized for distributed memory systems, where an excellent scalability with the number of CPUs is observed.},

@article{Usami:06:Theoretical-study-on,
	Abstract = {Anomalocarid arthropod is the largest known predatory animal of middle Cambrian. Studies on Anomalocaris have been piled up in the past two decades since the first reasonable reconstruction had achieved in 1980s. Recent finding of legs beneath lobes on Parapeytoia Yunnanensis shows arthropod affinities, however, many researchers believe that it must be a powerful swimmer by the use of developed lobes. In this work, we investigate swimming behaviour of Anomalocaris in water by performing hydrodynamical calculation. As a result of simulation using moving particle method possible swimming motion of Anomalocaris is obtained. In the computer we can change the morphology from known bauplan of Anomalocaris found as fossil record. It makes us possible to discuss on the variants of Anomalocaris at the intermediate state of evolution process. Such new methodology using computer reveals how and from where Anomalocaris evolved.},

@article{Wang;Li;Tang:08:Efficient-computatio,
	Abstract = {This paper deals with the application of a moving grid method to the solution of a phase-field model for dendritic growth in two- and three-dimensions. A mesh is found as the solution of an optimization problem that automatically includes the boundary conditions and is solved using a multi-grid approach. The governing equations are discretized in space by linear finite elements and a split time-level scheme is used to numerically integrate in time. One novel aspect of the method is the choice of a regularized monitor function. The moving grid method enables us to obtain accurate numerical solutions with much less degree of freedoms.

	Abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin finite element method has been developed to treat the high-order spatial derivatives appearing in the Cahn--Hilliard equation. The Cahn--Hilliard equation is a fourth-order nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation, originally proposed to model phase segregation of binary alloys. The developed discontinuous Galerkin approach avoids the need for mixed finite element methods, coupled equations or interpolation functions with a high degree of continuity that have been employed in the literature to treat the fourth-order spatial derivatives. The variational formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, its implementation and numerical examples are presented. In this communication, it is also shown under what conditions the method is stable, and an error estimate in an energy-type norm is presented. The method is evaluated by comparison with a standard finite element treatment in which the Cahn--Hilliard equation is decomposed into two coupled partial differential equations.},

@article{Wodo;Ganapathysubramanian:11:Computationally-effi,
	Abstract = {We present an efficient numerical framework for analyzing spinodal decomposition described by the Cahn--Hilliard equation. We focus on the analysis of various implicit time schemes for two and three dimensional problems. We demonstrate that significant computational gains can be obtained by applying embedded, higher order Runge--Kutta methods in a time adaptive setting. This allows accessing time-scales that vary by five orders of magnitude. In addition, we also formulate a set of test problems that isolate each of the sub-processes involved in spinodal decomposition: interface creation and bulky phase coarsening. We analyze the error fluctuations using these test problems on the split form of the Cahn--Hilliard equation solved using the finite element method with basis functions of different orders. Any scheme that ensures at least four elements per interface satisfactorily captures both sub-processes. Our findings show that linear basis functions have superior error-to-cost properties.
This strategy -- coupled with a domain decomposition based parallel implementation -- let us notably augment the efficiency of a numerical Cahn--Hillard solver, and open new venues for its practical applications, especially when three dimensional problems are considered. We use this framework to address the isoperimetric problem of identifying local solutions in the periodic cube in three dimensions. The framework is able to generate all five hypothesized candidates for the local solution of periodic isoperimetric problem in 3D -- sphere, cylinder, lamella, doubly periodic surface with genus two (Lawson surface) and triply periodic minimal surface (P Schwarz surface).},

@article{Yang;Zabaras:98:The-Adjoint-Method-f,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic procedure based on the adjoint method for solving a class of inverse directional alloy solidification design problems in which a desired growth velocityvfis achieved under stable growth conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a continuum adjoint formulation is proposed for the solution of an inverse problem with simultaneous heat and mass transfer, thermo-solutal convection, and phase change. In this paper, the interfacial stability is considered to imply a sharp solid--liquid freezing interface. This condition is enforced using the constitutional undercooling criterion in the form of an inequality constraint between the thermal and solute concentration gradients,GandGc, respectively, at the freezing front. The main unknowns of the design problem are the heating and/or cooling boundary conditions on the mold walls. The inverse design problem is formulated as a functional optimization problem. The cost functional is defined by the square of theL2norm of the deviation of the freezing interface temperature from the temperature corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium. A continuum adjoint system is derived to calculate the adjoint temperature, concentration, and velocity fields such that the gradient of the cost functional can be expressed analytically. The cost functional minimization process is realized by the conjugate gradient method via the finite element method solutions of the continuum direct, sensitivity, and adjoint problems. The developed formulation is demonstrated with an example of designing the directional solidification of a binary aqueous solution in a rectangular mold such that a stable vertical interface advances from left to right with a desired growth velocity.},

@article{Zaeem;Mesarovic:10:Finite-element-metho,
	Abstract = {Phase-field models with conserved phase-field variables result in a 4th order evolution partial differential equation (PDE). When coupled with the usual 2nd order thermo-mechanics equations, such problems require special treatment. In the past, the finite element method (FEM) has been successfully applied to non-conserved phase fields, governed by a 2nd order PDE. For higher order equations, the convergence of the standard Galerkin FEM requires that the interpolation functions belong to a higher continuity class.
We consider the Cahn--Hilliard phase-field model for diffusion-controlled solid state phase transformation in binary alloys, coupled with elasticity of the solid phases. A Galerkin finite element formulation is developed, with mixed-order interpolation: C0 interpolation functions for displacements, and C1 interpolation functions for the phase-field variable.
To demonstrate convergence of the mixed interpolation scheme, we first study a one-dimensional problem -- nucleation and growth of the intermediate phase in a thin-film diffusion couple with elasticity effects. Then, we study the effects of completeness of C1 interpolation on parabolic problems in two space dimensions by considering the growth of the intermediate phase in a binary system.
Quadratic convergence, expected for conforming elements, is achieved for both one- and two-dimensional systems.},
