This directory contains examples for solving the Stefan problem with the CASL p4est library.

It differs from the "stefan" directory in that these examples utilize the poisson_nodes_mls class to solve the Poisson problem,
rather than the poisson_nodes class. It does not necessarily make use of the MLS(multiple level set) capabilities, but rather
utilizes the poisson_nodes_mls solver because it is the most up to date and powerful Poisson solver contained in the library
at the time.
