\opening{Dear Editor,} 
We would like to appreciate the invaluable comments made by the reviewers. We
have made adjustments to our article, titled `\textbf{Parallel level-set methods
on adaptive tree-based grids}', to address the issues raised by the reviewers as
detailed below. 

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Reviewer \#1} \\ 
The first reviewer has suggested to include ``\textit{some basic library codes
in appendix, each matching its level set algorithm}''. Indeed it is important
for the scientific community to share knowledge and facilitate ways for
reproducing scientific work for others. In the case of computational science,
unfortunately, this is a very daunting task that is not always possible.  Many
scientific codes are highly specialized and are often too technical to be fitted
into a paper. 

Specifically, in our case, our library amounts to nearly 30,000 lines of code,
spread across more than 50 files and with complex dependencies. As such, it is
practically not viable to include sample codes in the paper. Moreover, we
believe inclusion of actual code, which involves many technical details, e.g.
error checking, profiling tools, comments, etc., is not scientifically
educational and may further alienate the reader from main message of the paper.

Instead, and in accordance to the second reviewer who has raised related issues,
we have opted to revise the pseudo-codes in the algorithms to make them more
clear. We believe that the modifications should make the algorithms easier to
understand and useful to the readers.

\item \textbf{Reviewer \#2} \\ 
The second reviewer has raised several issues, mostly related to the
pseudo-codes in the paper, as well as suggesting additional numerical tests.
These issues are addressed as detailed below: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item ``\textit{It is recommended that the authors' pseudocode be closer to a
  language that many people are familiar with like C++ or Fortran 90}.''

Our library is coded in `\texttt{c++}' (with a mix of little `\texttt{c}' code).
We have made adjustments to the to algorithms to make them easier to understand.
However, we believe it is best not to directly use a `\texttt{c++}' syntax to
keep the pseudo-code language-agnostic and accessible to all readers.

\item ``\textit{In Algorithm 2, what is the definition of “rank”? “owner’s
  rank”? “mpirank”? “st”?}''

\item ``\textit{}''

\item ``\textit{}''

\item ``\textit{}'' \end{itemize} \end{itemize}


In light of these adjustments, we respectfully ask that our article be
reconsidered for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics.
\closing{Sincerely,} 
Mohammad Mirzadeh (on behalf of all authors)
