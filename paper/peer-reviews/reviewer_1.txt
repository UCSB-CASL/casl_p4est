Reviewer #1: 
The article discusses a parallel implementation of the level-set
method. In a shared-moemry computer, its implementation is trivial, as stated in
page 7. In a distributed-memory model, however, there arise issues of memory
distribution and communication scheduling. The authors use an open source
library(p4est) for memory distribution and a simple strategy(Algorithm 2) for
comminications between CPUs. Basically, the submission introduces a successful
parallel implementation of the level-set method in octrees. It will be helpful
to JCP audiences who needs to perform the level-set method in ultra fine scales.
I suggest including some basic library codes in appendix, each matching its
level set algorithm.
